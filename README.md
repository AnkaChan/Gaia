# Gaia
Gaia Physics Engine

Gaia engine is a C++ code base designed mainly for physics based simulation. It provides a set of useful tools, including a powerful triangular/tet mesh data structure, a convenient parameter IO module, a set of efficient collision detectors, and a virtual physics framework that can be extended to support all sorts of solvers.

Gaia is engineered to enhance the efficiency of both developers and the hardware it operates on. Occasionally, compromises are necessary since optimizing for one can adversely affect the other. It may not have the smartest design in every way. However, it's assured that Gaia is free from any stupid designs.
